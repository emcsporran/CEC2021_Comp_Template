# CEC2021_Comp_Template

This repository was created for the 2021 Canadian Engineering Competition Programming Challenge by myself, Eleanor McSporran.

The focus of this challange was to try and analyse the power generation of the province of New Brunswick and produce an script that determines the best allocation of resources.

The purpose of the competition was to challenge contestants to solve a technical problem, from both a coding solution perspective, and also from a engineering problem solving approach.

The competition case document is written in both English and French, due to the national nature of the competition.

For more information on the compeition see the [CFES|FCEG Website](https://cfes.ca/cec/).
